# Simple-Port-Scanner
My first real project. Thanks to TCM Security. This is my take on that scanner with a few minor changes to make it a little more user friendly.

Thanks to TCM Sec for their Ethical Hacking course that walked me through how to set one of these up. I made a few changes for some usability stuff.
